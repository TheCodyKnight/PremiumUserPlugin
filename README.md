# PremiumUserPlugin
I am using this Plugin to experiment with the Shopware system.
The base functionality is taken from the Shopware documentation ( https://developers.shopware.com/developers-guide/plugin-quick-start/ )
Anything else is developed by myself.

This plugin is not intended for official release and you may reuse whatever code you like from it.

Features the plugin contains now: <br />
-displaying a random famous quote for premium members in the shop header
-generating a new "premium" customer group

Features the plugin will contain in the future: <br />
-the ability to buy into premium usership <br />
-setting a discount for premium users
